# Weather website test
This  is a simple weather website created by myself(sanjay.k) for a test purpose using openweather map api to display the current weather of the location that is searched by the user.

# Technologies used
HTML,CSS-for frontend
Javascript-for backend and functionality of website

# Instructions
- on first open it will display my native location weather which is coimbatore but, after         searching it will display the searched location weather details

# How i Made it
- first i have created the html and css in vscode
- then i have created the script.js by first declaring the api key and using the openweatherapi call to access the specific location weather.here instead of a specific location i have created a variable city to get the specic details each time the user searches
-then i have created the weather function to get the details of each searched location and the details will be updated in the html after searching.
